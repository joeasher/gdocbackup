# gdocbackup
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/gdocbackup (on 29-May-2015)

The original developer has announced on that Google Code project homepage that the project is no longer actively developed or maintained.

Looks like they created a placeholder repository on GitHub last year: https://github.com/fhtino/gdocbackup (it just links back to the Google Code project).

Given that Google Code is due to be shut down, and a recent critial issue in GDocBackup (probably due to a change in Google APIs), I wanted to (at the very least) back the project up by exporting to GitHub. That's what this repository is.

I've no idea if this is set up correctly, but at the very least it seemed like a comprehensive backup.

I won't be able to look at it again until late June 2015. Until then, feel free to leave comments/issues/whatever.

Cheers.
